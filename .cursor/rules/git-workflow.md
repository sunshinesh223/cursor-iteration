# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

<body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

Examples:

- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix: resolve null pointer in auth service`
- `refactor: extract validation logic`
- `docs: update API documentation`
- `test: add tests for user service`

## Branch Naming

- `feature/short-description` - New features
- `fix/issue-description` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/component-name` - Refactoring
- `docs/topic` - Documentation updates

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:

1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Create implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Review immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
